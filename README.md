Pong project CS 4398/5394

Collaborators: Sean Summers, Mason Currie, Alejandro Carrillo

Java JDK14 with JavaFX 14 and Scenebuilder

This will be where we put our report for the assignment:

The goal of this project was to create a Pong like game with an added multiplayer feature that would work P2P over the same network. After doing some research we learned that server to client is a more secure approach and would be easier to implement. We started programming the project and built some of the functionality using an older version of Java that supported Applet, which was our original plan but we learned that it would be a better project if we were to use a more recent version of Java and decided that learning JavaFX may be useful to us in our future careers, so we made the switch to Java 14 and JavaFX for our GUI. 

By using scenebuilder built into the Jetbrains IDE IntelliJ, we were able to create a menu scene within the menu.xml file. In the next version we will add the server-to-client functionality that allows the user to click either single player or multiplayer. The current version is the working code for the single player function.

Conclusion: While there is more work to be done, we have learned a lot from this project. JavaFX and Java14 was new to all of us, so there was quite the learning curve, but we were able to develop a solid framework for a program that could be finished and polished in less than a month of work. We have also learned a lot about software development principles and the importance of good version control. Learning and using Github has made this project both challenging and easier, as the learning curve for Github was a challenge for all of us but once we figured it out it was immensely helpful.
